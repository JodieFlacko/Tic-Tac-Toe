# Tica-Tac-Toe

Project "Tic-Tac-Toe" from The Odin Project course. Simple yet catchy version of tic-tac-toe. 
User is able to see score, what was the winning row, and who's turn is when he clicks on the board. Missing a button to restart.
For the moment user should restart the game by refreshing the page.
